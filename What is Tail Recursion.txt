To achieve tail recursion, you must ensure that the recursive call is the last operation in a function or predicate. This allows the compiler or interpreter to optimize the call by reusing the current stack frame, avoiding stack growth and potential overflows.

üîÅ Step-by-Step: How to Achieve Tail Recursion
	1.	Add an Accumulator Argument
Introduce an extra parameter (called an accumulator) to collect intermediate results as the recursion proceeds.
	2.	Shift Work to Before the Recursive Call
Ensure any work (e.g. computation or list construction) is done before the recursive call, so the call is the final action.
	3.	Make the Recursive Call the Last Expression
The recursive call must return directly without further computation. In Prolog or functional languages, this means:

my_tail_recursive(X, Acc, Result) :- ... , my_tail_recursive(NewX, NewAcc, Result).


	4.	Use a Wrapper Function
Write a wrapper that starts with a default value for the accumulator and calls the tail-recursive version.

‚úÖ Example: Tail-Recursive List Reversal (Prolog)

% Wrapper
reverse(L, R) :- reverse_acc(L, [], R).

% Tail-recursive helper
reverse_acc([], Acc, Acc).  % Base case: done
reverse_acc([H|T], Acc, R) :- reverse_acc(T, [H|Acc], R).

Here:
	‚Ä¢	Acc accumulates the reversed list.
	‚Ä¢	The recursive call is the final operation (reverse_acc/3).
	‚Ä¢	No computation follows the recursive step.

‚∏ª

üö´ Non-Tail-Recursive Version

reverse([], []).
reverse([H|T], R) :-
    reverse(T, RT),
    append(RT, [H], R).  % Not tail-recursive due to append after the call

Here, append/3 happens after the recursive call, so it cannot be optimized for tail recursion.

üìå Summary

To achieve tail recursion:
	‚Ä¢	Use an accumulator.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure the recursive call is the last step.
	‚Ä¢	Wrap the call with a helper if needed.
	‚Ä¢	This transformation ensures constant stack space and improves performance and reliability.
